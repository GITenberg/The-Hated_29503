<h1><big>THE HATED</big></h1>

<h2>By PAUL FLEHR</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b><i>After space, there was always
one more river to cross ... the
far side of hatred and murder!</i></b></big></p></div>

<div class="bk2"><p><b>Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS</b></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> bar didn't have a name.
No name of any kind. Not
even an indication that it
had ever had one. All it said on the
outside was:</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="center">Cafe<br />
EAT<br />
<i>Cocktails</i></p></div>

<p class="noin">which doesn't make a lot of sense.
But it was a bar. It had a big TV
set going ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta in three
glorious colors, and a jukebox that
tried to drown out the TV with
that lousy music they play. Anyway,
it wasn't a kid hangout. I
kind of like it. But I wasn't supposed
to be there at all; it's in the
contract. I was supposed to stay
in New York and the New England
states.</p>

<p>Cafe-EAT-<i>Cocktails</i> was right
across the river. I think the name
of the place was Hoboken, but
I'm not sure. It all had a kind
of dreamy feeling to it. I was&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, I couldn't even remember
going there. I remembered one
minute I was downtown New
York, looking across the river. I
did that a lot. And then I was
there. I don't remember crossing
the river at all.</p>

<p>I was drunk, you know.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">You</span> know how it is? Double
bourbons and keep them coming.
And after a while the bartender
stops bringing me the ginger
ale because gradually I forget to
mix them. I got pretty loaded long
before I left New York. I realize
that. I guess I had to get pretty
loaded to risk the pension and all.</p>

<p>Used to be I didn't drink much,
but now, I don't know, when I
have one drink, I get to thinking
about Sam and Wally and Chowderhead
and Gilvey and the captain.
If I don't drink, I think about
them, too, and then I take a drink.
And that leads to another drink,
and it all comes out to the same
thing. Well, I guess I said it already,
I drink a pretty good
amount, but you can't blame me.</p>

<p>There was a girl.</p>

<p>I always get a girl someplace.
Usually they aren't much and this
one wasn't either. I mean she was
probably somebody's mother. She
was around thirty-five and not so
bad, though she had a long scar
under her ear down along her
throat to the little round spot
where her larynx was. It wasn't
ugly. She smelled nice&mdash;while I
could still smell, you know&mdash;and
she didn't talk much. I liked that.
Only&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, did you ever meet somebody
with a nervous cough? Like
when you say something funny&mdash;a
little funny, not a big yock&mdash;they
don't laugh and they don't
stop with just smiling, but they
sort of cough? She did that. I began
to itch. I couldn't help it. I
asked her to stop it.</p>

<p>She spilled her drink and looked
at me almost as though she was
scared&mdash;and I had tried to say it
quietly, too.</p>

<p>"Sorry," she said, a little angry,
a little scared. "<i>Sorry.</i> But you
don't have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it."</p>

<p>"Sure. But you asked me to sit
down here with you, remember?
If you're going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Forget it!</i>" I nodded at the
bartender and held up two fingers.
"You need another drink," I said.
"The thing is," I said, "Gilvey used
to do that."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That cough."</p>

<p>She looked puzzled. "You mean
like this?"</p>

<p>"<i>Goddam it, stop it!</i>" Even the
bartender looked over at me that
time. Now she was really mad,
but I didn't want her to go away.
I said, "Gilvey was a fellow who
went to Mars with me. Pat Gilvey."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh.</i>" She sat down again and
leaned across the table, low.
"<i>Mars.</i>"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> bartender brought our
drinks and looked at me suspiciously.
I said, "Say, Mac, would
you turn down the air-conditioning?"</p>

<p>"My name isn't Mac. No."</p>

<p>"Have a heart. It's too cold in
here."</p>

<p>"Sorry." He didn't sound sorry.</p>

<p>I was cold. I mean that kind of
weather, it's always cold in those
places. You know around New
York in August? It hits eighty,
eighty-five, ninety. All the places
have air-conditioning and what
they really want is for you to wear
a shirt and tie.</p>

<p>But I like to walk a lot. You
would, too, you know. And you
can't walk around much in long
pants and a suit coat and all that
stuff. Not around there. Not in
August. And so then, when I went
into a bar, it'd have one of those
built-in freezers for the used-car
salesmen with their dates, or maybe
their wives, all dressed up. For
what? But I froze.</p>

<p>"<i>Mars</i>," the girl breathed.
"<i>Mars.</i>"</p>

<p>I began to itch again. "Want
to dance?"</p>

<p>"They don't have a license,"
she said. "Byron, <i>I</i> didn't know
you'd been to <i>Mars</i>! Please <i>tell</i> me
about it."</p>

<p>"It was all right," I said.</p>

<p>That was a lie.</p>

<p>She was interested. She forgot
to smile. It made her look nicer.
She said, "I knew a man&mdash;my
brother-in-law&mdash;he was my husband's
brother&mdash;I mean my ex-husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I get the idea."</p>

<p>"He worked for General Atomic.
In Rockford, Illinois. You know
where that is?"</p>

<p>"Sure." I couldn't go there, but
I knew where Illinois was.</p>

<p>"He worked on the first Mars
ship. Oh, fifteen years ago, wasn't
it? He always wanted to go himself,
but he couldn't pass the tests."
She stopped and looked at me.</p>

<p>I knew what she was thinking.
But I didn't always look this way,
you know. Not that there's anything
wrong with me now, I mean,
but I couldn't pass the tests any
more. Nobody can. That's why
we're all one-trippers.</p>

<p>I said, "The only reason I'm
shaking like this is because I'm
cold."</p>

<p>It wasn't true, of course. It was
that cough of Gilvey's. I didn't
like to think about Gilvey, or Sam
or Chowderhead or Wally or the
captain. I didn't like to think
about any of them. It made me
shake.</p>

<p>You see, we couldn't kill each
other. They wouldn't let us do
that. Before we took off, they did
something to our minds to make
sure. What they did, it doesn't
last forever. It lasts for two years
and then it wears off. That's long
enough, you see, because that gets
you to Mars and back; and it's
plenty long enough, in another
way, because it's like a strait-jacket.</p>

<p>You know how to make a baby
cry? Hold his hands. It's the most
basic thing there is. What they did
to us so we couldn't kill each
other, it was like being tied up,
like having our hands held so we
couldn't get free. Well. But two
years was long enough. Too long.</p>

<p>The bartender came over and
said, "Pal, I'm sorry. See, I turned
the air-conditioning down. You all
right? You look so&mdash;"</p>

<p>I said, "Sure, I'm all right."</p>

<p>He sounded worried. I hadn't
even heard him come back. The
girl was looking worried, too, I
guess because I was shaking so
hard I was spilling my drink. I
put some money on the table
without even counting it.</p>

<p>"It's all right," I said. "We were
just going."</p>

<p>"We were?" She looked confused.
But she came along with
me. They always do, once they
find out you've been to Mars.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the next place, she said, between
trips to the powder
room, "It must take a lot of
courage to sign up for something
like that. Were you scientifically
inclined in school? Don't you have
to know an awful lot to be a space-flyer?
Did you ever see any of
those little monkey characters they
say live on Mars? I read an article
about how they lived in little
cities of pup-tents or something
like that&mdash;only they didn't make
them, they grew them. Funny!
Ever see those? That trip must
have been a real drag, I bet. What
is it, nine months? You couldn't
have a baby! Excuse me&mdash; Say, tell
me. All that time, how'd you&mdash;well,
manage things? I mean didn't you
ever have to go to the you-know
or anything?"</p>

<p>"We managed," I said.</p>

<p>She giggled, and that reminded
her, so she went to the powder
room again. I thought about getting
up and leaving while she was
gone, but what was the use of that?
I'd only pick up somebody else.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight. A couple
of minutes wouldn't hurt. I reached
in my pocket for the little box
of pills they give us&mdash;it isn't refillable,
but we get a new prescription
in the mail every month, along
with the pension check. The label
on the box said:</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="center">CAUTION</p>

<p><i>Use only as directed by physician.
Not to be taken by
persons suffering heart condition,
digestive upset or circulatory
disease. Not to be
used in conjunction with alcoholic
beverages.</i></p></div>

<p>I took three of them. I don't
like to start them before midnight,
but anyway I stopped shaking.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, and then I
was on the ship again. The noise
in the bar became the noise of
the rockets and the air washers
and the sludge sluicers. I began
to sweat, although this place was
air-conditioned, too.</p>

<p>I could hear Wally whistling to
himself the way he did, the sound
muffled by his oxygen mask and
drowned in the rocket noise, but
still perfectly audible. The tune
was <i>Sophisticated Lady</i>. Sometimes
it was <i>Easy to Love</i> and
sometimes <i>Chasing Shadows</i>, but
mostly <i>Sophisticated Lady</i>. He
was from Juilliard.</p>

<p>Somebody sneezed, and it
sounded just like Chowderhead
sneezing. You know how everybody
sneezes according to his own
individual style? Chowderhead
had a ladylike little sneeze; it
went <i>hutta</i>, real quick, all through
the mouth, no nose involved. The
captain went <i>Hrasssh</i>; Wally was
Ashoo, ashoo, <i>ashoo</i>. Gilvey was
<i>Hutch</i>-uh. Sam didn't sneeze much,
but he sort of coughed and
sprayed, and that was worse.</p>

<p>Sometimes I used to think about
killing Sam by tying him down
and having Wally and the captain
sneeze him to death. But that
was a kind of a joke, naturally,
when I was feeling good. Or pretty
good. Usually I thought about a
knife for Sam. For Chowderhead
it was a gun, right in the belly,
one shot. For Wally it was a tommy
gun&mdash;just stitching him up and
down, you know, back and forth.
The captain I would put in a cage
with hungry lions, and Gilvey I'd
strangle with my bare hands. That
was probably because of the cough,
I guess.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> was back. "Please tell me
about it," she begged. "I'm <i>so</i>
curious."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes. "You want
me to tell you about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please!"</p>

<p>"About what it's like to fly to
Mars on a rocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"All right," I said.</p>

<p>It's wonderful what three little
white pills will do. I wasn't even
shaking.</p>

<p>"There's six men, see? In a
space the size of a Buick, and
that's all the room there is. Two
of us in the bunks all the time,
four of us on watch. Maybe you
want to stay in the sack an extra
ten minutes&mdash;because it's the only
place on the ship where you can
stretch out, you know, the only
place where you can rest without
somebody's elbow in your side.
But you can't. Because by then
it's the next man's turn.</p>

<p>"And maybe you don't have elbows
in your side while it's your
turn off watch, but in the starboard
bunk there's the air-regenerator
master valve&mdash;I bet I
could still show you the bruises
right around my kidneys&mdash;and in
the port bunk there's the emergency-escape-hatch
handle. That gets
you right in the temple, if you
turn your head too fast.</p>

<p>"And you can't really sleep, I
mean not soundly, because of the
noise. That is, when the rockets
are going. When they aren't going,
then you're in free-fall, and
that's bad, too, because you dream
about falling. But when they're going,
I don't know, I think it's worse.
It's pretty loud.</p>

<p>"And even if it weren't for the
noise, if you sleep too soundly you
might roll over on your oxygen
line. Then you dream about drowning.
Ever do that? You're strangling
and choking and you can't
get any air? It isn't dangerous, I
guess. Anyway, it always woke me
up in time. Though I heard about
a fellow in a flight six years ago&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well. So you've always got
this oxygen mask on, all the time,
except if you take it off for a second
to talk to somebody. You
don't do that very often, because
what is there to say? Oh, maybe
the first couple of weeks, sure&mdash;everybody's
friends then. You
don't even need the mask, for that
matter. Or not very much. Everybody's
still pretty clean. The place
smells&mdash;oh, let's see&mdash;about like the
locker room in a gym. You know?
You can stand it. That's if nobody's
got space sickness, of
course. We were lucky that way.</p>

<p>"But that's about how it's going
to get anyway, you know. Outside
the masks, it's soup. It isn't that
you smell it so much. You kind of
<i>taste</i> it, in the back of your mouth,
and your eyes sting. That's after
the first two or three months. Later
on, it gets worse.</p>

<p>"And with the mask on, of
course, the oxygen mixture is coming
in under pressure. That's funny
if you're not used to it. Your
lungs have to work a little bit
harder to get rid of it, especially
when you're asleep, so after a
while the muscles get sore. And
then they get sorer. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well.</p>

<p>"Before we take off, the psych
people give us a long doo-da that
keeps us from killing each other.
But they can't stop us from thinking
about it. And afterward, after
we're back on Earth&mdash;this is what
you won't read about in the articles&mdash;they
keep us apart. You
know how they work it? We get a
pension, naturally. I mean there's
got to be a pension, otherwise there
isn't enough money in the world
to make anybody go. But in the
contract, it says to get the pension
we have to stay in our own area.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="353" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"The whole country's marked
off. Six sections. Each has at least
one big city in it. I was lucky, I
got a lot of them. They try to
keep it so every man's home town
is in his own section, but&mdash;well,
like with us, Chowderhead and the
captain both happened to come
from Santa Monica. I think it
was Chowderhead that got California,
Nevada, all that Southwest
area. It was the luck of the
draw. God knows what the captain
got.</p>

<p>"Maybe New Jersey," I said,
and took another white pill.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> went on to another place
and she said suddenly, "I
figured something out. The way
you keep looking around."</p>

<p>"What did you figure out?"</p>

<p>"Well, part of it was what you
said about the other fellow getting
New Jersey. This is New Jersey.
You don't belong in this section,
right?"</p>

<p>"Right," I said after a minute.</p>

<p>"So why are you here? I know
why. You're here because you're
looking for somebody."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>She said triumphantly, "You
want to find that other fellow from
your crew! You want to fight
him!"</p>

<p>I couldn't help shaking, white
pills or no white pills. But I had
to correct her.</p>

<p>"No. I want to kill him."</p>

<p>"How do you know he's here?
He's got a lot of states to roam
around in, too, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Six. New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland&mdash;all the way
down to Washington."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll be here." I didn't have to
tell her how I knew. But I knew.</p>

<p>I wasn't the only one who spent
his time at the border of his assigned
area, looking across the
river or staring across a state line,
knowing that somebody was on
the other side. I knew. You fight
a war and you don't have to guess
that the enemy might have his
troops a thousand miles away from
the battle line. You know where
his troops will be. You know he
wants to fight, too.</p>

<p><i>Hutta. Hutta.</i></p>

<p>I spilled my drink.</p>

<p>I looked at her. "You&mdash;you
didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked frightened. "What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>"<i>Did you just sneeze?</i>"</p>

<p>"Sneeze? Me? Did I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I said something quick and
nasty, I don't know what. No! It
hadn't been her. I knew it.</p>

<p>It was Chowderhead's sneeze.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Chowderhead</span>. Marvin T.
Roebuck, his name was. Five
feet eight inches tall. Dark-complected,
with a cast in one eye.
Spoke with a Midwest kind of
accent, even though he came from
California&mdash;"shrick" for "shriek,"
"hawror" for "horror," like that. It
drove me crazy after a while. Maybe
that gives you an idea what he
talked about mostly. A skunk. A
thoroughgoing, deep-rooted, mother-murdering
skunk.</p>

<p>I kicked over my chair and
roared, "Roebuck! Where are you,
damn you?"</p>

<p>The bar was all at once silent.
Only the jukebox kept going.</p>

<p>"I know you're here!" I
screamed. "Come out and get it!
You louse, I told you I'd get you
for calling me a liar the day Wally
sneaked a smoke!"</p>

<p>Silence, everybody looking at
me.</p>

<p>Then the door of the men's room
opened.</p>

<p>He came out.</p>

<p>He looked <i>lousy</i>. Eyes all red-rimmed
and his hair falling out&mdash;the
poor crumb couldn't have been
over twenty-nine. He shrieked,
"You!" He called me a million
names. He said, "You thieving
rat, I'll teach you to try to cheat
me out of my candy ration!"</p>

<p>He had a knife.</p>

<p>I didn't care. I didn't have anything
and that was stupid, but it
didn't matter. I got a bottle of
beer from the next table and
smashed it against the back of a
chair. It made a good weapon, you
know; I'd take that against a knife
any time.</p>

<p>I ran toward him, and he came
all staggering and lurching toward
me, looking crazy and desperate,
mumbling and raving&mdash;I could
hardly hear him, because I was
talking, too. Nobody tried to stop
us. Somebody went out the door
and I figured it was to call the
cops, but that was all right. Once
I took care of Chowderhead, I
didn't care what the cops did.</p>

<p>I went for the face.</p>

<p>He cut me first. I felt the knife
slide up along my left arm but,
you know, it didn't even hurt, only
kind of stung a little. I didn't care
about that. I got him in the face,
and the bottle came away, and it
was all like gray and white jelly,
and then blood began to spring
out. He screamed. Oh, that scream!
I never heard anything like that
scream. It was what I had been
waiting all my life for.</p>

<p>I kicked him as he staggered
back, and he fell. And I was on
top of him, with the bottle, and
I was careful to stay away from
the heart or the throat, because
that was too quick, but I worked
over the face, and I felt his knife
get me a couple times more, and&mdash;</p>

<p>And&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">And</span> I woke up, you know. And
there was Dr. Santly over me
with a hypodermic needle that he'd
just taken out of my arm, and four
male nurses in fatigues holding
me down. And I was drenched
with sweat.</p>

<p>For a minute, I didn't know
where I was. It was a horrible
queasy falling sensation, as though
the bar and the fight and the
world were all dissolving into
smoke around me.</p>

<p>Then I knew where I was.</p>

<p>It was almost worse.</p>

<p>I stopped yelling and just lay
there, looking up at them.</p>

<p>Dr. Santly said, trying to keep
his face friendly and noncommittal,
"You're doing much better,
Byron, boy. <i>Much</i> better."</p>

<p>I didn't say anything.</p>

<p>He said, "You worked through
the whole thing in two hours and
eight minutes. Remember the first
time? You were sixteen hours killing
him. Captain Van Wyck it was
that time, remember? Who was it
this time?"</p>

<p>"Chowderhead." I looked at the
male nurses. Doubtfully, they let
go of my arms and legs.</p>

<p>"Chowderhead," said Dr. Santly.
"Oh&mdash;Roebuck. That boy," he
said mournfully, his expression
saddened, "he's not coming along
nearly as well as you. <i>Nearly.</i> He
can't run through a cycle in less
than five hours. And, that's peculiar,
it's usually you he&mdash; Well,
I better not say that, shall I? No
sense setting up a counter-impression
when your pores are all open,
so to speak?" He smiled at me,
but he was a little worried in back
of the smile.</p>

<p>I sat up. "Anybody got a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Give him a cigarette, Johnson,"
the doctor ordered the male nurse
standing alongside my right foot.</p>

<p>Johnson did. I fired up.</p>

<p>"You're coming along <i>splendidly</i>,"
Dr. Santly said. He was one
of these psych guys that thinks if
you say it's so, it makes it so. You
know that kind? "We'll have you
down under an hour before the
end of the week. That's <i>marvelous</i>
progress. Then we can work on the
conscious level! You're doing extremely
well, whether you know it
or not. Why, in six months&mdash;say
in eight months, because I like
to be conservative&mdash;" he twinkled
at me&mdash;"we'll have you out of
here! You'll be the first of your
crew to be discharged, you know
that?"</p>

<p>"That's nice," I said. "The others
aren't doing so well?"</p>

<p>"No. Not at all well, most of
them. Particularly Dr. Gilvey. The
run-throughs leave him in terrible
shape. I don't mind admitting I'm
worried about him."</p>

<p>"That's nice," I said, and this
time I meant it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> looked at me thoughtfully,
but all he did was say to the
male nurses, "He's all right now.
Help him off the table."</p>

<p>It was hard standing up. I had
to hold onto the rail around the
table for a minute. I said my set
little speech: "Dr. Santly, I want
to tell you again how grateful I
am for this. I was reconciled to
living the rest of my life confined
to one part of the country, the
way the other crews always did.
But this is much better. I appreciate
it. I'm sure the others do,
too."</p>

<p>"Of course, boy. Of course." He
took out a fountain pen and made
a note on my chart; I couldn't
see what it was, but he looked
gratified. "It's no more than you
have coming to you, Byron," he
said. "I'm grateful that I could
be the one to make it come to
pass."</p>

<p>He glanced conspiratorially at
the male nurses. "You know how
important this is to me. It's the
triumph of a whole new approach
to psychic rehabilitation. I mean
to say our heroes of space travel
are entitled to freedom when they
come back home to Earth, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Definitely," I said, scrubbing
some of the sweat off my face
onto my sleeve.</p>

<p>"So we've got to end this system
of designated areas. We can't
avoid the tensions that accompany
space travel, no. But if we can
help you eliminate harmful tensions
with a few run-throughs, why,
it's not too high a price to pay,
is it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"I mean to say," he said, warming
up, "you can look forward
to the time when you'll be able to
mingle with your old friends from
the rocket, free and easy, without
any need for restraint. That's a lot
to look forward to, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is," I said. "I look forward
to it very much," I said. "And I
know exactly what I'm going to
do the first time I meet one&mdash;I
mean without any restraints, as
you say," I said. And it was true;
I did. Only it wouldn't be a broken
beer bottle that I would do it
with.</p>

<p>I had much more elaborate ideas
than that.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
